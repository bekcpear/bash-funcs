## A set of unit functions of bash

These files which beginning with a `_` can be sourced from any bash script to provide corresponding functions without any other dependencies.

They also can be inserted into existing bash file manually or by executing [ins.sh](ins.sh) script expediently. If you use ins.sh to insert/update the functions, please aware that do not remove `# BASHFUNC` prefixed comments due to this script use them to locate existing functions.

More details please refer to comments within `_` prefixed files.

Looking forward to more unit functions.
